In the quiet hush of twilight's grace,
Where shadows stretch and silence hums a hymn,
A single star begins to softly gleam,
A beacon in the vast, eternal dream.

The moon ascends, a pearl in midnight's crown,
Reflecting light on fields and hallowed ground.
The wind, a whisper through the ancient trees,
Sings lullabies to the sleeping seas.

Beneath the velvet cloak of night so deep,
Where stars like silver needles stitch the sky,
A wanderer walks, with thoughts that will not sleep,
Dreaming of love, of home, and why we try.

Oh, night, so vast, so still, so full of grace,
You cradle dreams in your eternal hold,
And in your quiet, the world's true heart is found,
Where time and silence are forever one.
